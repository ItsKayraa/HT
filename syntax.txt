 -- Syntax --

1) endcode

It adds the calls required to end the program at start label.

2) localvar [name] [value]

It adds a local variable for compiler (which will be not saved at the assembly) and you could use this local variable using 'uselv'.

3) unc [parameters] %endv [command...]

unc means uncalled function as it only stores one command inside it. You could store parameters inside it too.

4) libc [libraryScut]:[libraryFunc] [parameters]

Calls a library function with the given parameters.

5) using [librarypath] [scut (optional)]

Imports the library.
You may use a real path for librarypath or just a library .tc file which is in lib dictionary.
You can give a shortcut if you want. IF you don't, the scut will equal to library path.

examples:

using io.tc
using io32.tc
using ~/HT/lib/io.tc
using ~/HT/lib/io32.tc
using io.tc io
using io32.tc io32
using ~/HT/lib/io.tc io
using ~/HT/lib/io32.tc io32

6) printl

printl is a function made for especially beginners. It's just using "printl" function of "lib/io.tc" library. (It imports the library fully even if oyu use it only once!)

7) addAsmStr, addAsmData, addAsmText

Adds the given line to assembly at location. (addAsmStr = Add assembly at _start label. addAsmData = Add assembly at .data section. addAsmText = Add assembly at .text section.)
